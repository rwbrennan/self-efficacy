# Self-Efficacy Survey

The self-efficacy survey was developed in 2010 to support the graduate attributes collection and continual improvement (GA/CI) process at the Schulich School of Engineering (SSE). Our goal was to develop a survey that could be used each year, across multiple cohorts of students to supplement the direct assessments collected in each of our engineering programs.

The survey is given to students in their final year of study and includes 38 questions that are posed in the form of “how confident are you that you have the capability to perform each task listed below, if you were to enter the workforce today”. Students rate their confidence on a five-interval scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. This allowed for 3-4 questions per GA to keep the overall number of questions manageable, which in some cases means that not all indicators are included in the survey.
